# Networking-ARPPoisonNFaceFiltering

The third instalment in this series of networking projects. This time I will be the first time I will be using scapy, which a powerful tool that would have simplified a large portion of my two previous projects into a few lines as it can decodes, send and capture packets all by itself. Using scapy, I will be intercepting certain applicationsâ€™ credentials and ARP poisoning a target machine with the goal of sniffing its traffic and performing facial recognition on these packets to filter out any of interest.
